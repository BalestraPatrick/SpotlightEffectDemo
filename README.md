SpotlightEffectDemo
===================

This is a sample project on hwo to create a system like Spotlight in iOS 7. 
Everything is very simple. It's a UIScrollView with paging enabled and some adjustements. Every line is commented so you can understand how everything works.
If you find any grammar error in the comments, please report. :)

Developed with Xcode 4.6.3. Tested on iOS 6 but should work on every version with some corrections to the sizes.
